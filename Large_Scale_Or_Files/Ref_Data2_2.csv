"The data of the store offers several styles of Nike shoes is provided in ""Nike Shoes Sales.csv"". Through the dataset, the revenue of each shoes is listed in the column ""revenue"". The demand for each style is independent. The store__ objective is to maximize the total expected revenue based on the fixed initial inventories of the Nike x Olivia Kim brand, which are detailed in column __nventory._ During the sales horizon, no replenishment is allowed, and there are no in-transit inventories. Customer arrivals, corresponding to demand for different styles of Nike shoes, occur in each period according to a Poisson process, with arrival rates specified in column __emand._ Moreover, the trade will be started only when the total demand is no less than 100 to ensure the trading efficiency. The decision variables y_i represent the number of customer requests the store intends to fulfill for Nike shoe style i, with each y_i being a positive integer.

"Based on flight ticket options provided in the table, along with their average passengers (Avg Pax), average prices (Avg Price), and capacity coefficients (Flex Cpy Coef), considering that each Eco_flex ticket consumes 3 units of flight capacity and each Eco_lite ticket consumes 1 unit of capacity, while enforcing flow conservation constraints at each airport for long-term planning model, develop a Sales-Based Linear Programming (SBLP) model. 

The goal of this model is to recommend the optimal 2 flights that maximize total ticket sale revenue, specifically among flights where the origin-destination pairs are: 
OD = ('A', 'B') or OD = ('A', 'C') or OD = ('B', 'A') or OD = ('B', 'C') or ('C', 'A') or ('C', 'B') in a departure period (7am-4:05pm) in which the optional flights are:
[(OD = ('C', 'A') AND Departure Time='7:40'),
(OD = ('C', 'B') AND Departure Time='7:40'),
(OD = ('B', 'A') AND Departure Time='9:05'),
